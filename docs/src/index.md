# DifferentialEquations.jl: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Enabled Simulation and Estimation

This is a suite for numerically solving differential equations written in Julia
and available for use in Julia, Python, and R. The
purpose of this package is to supply efficient Julia implementations of solvers
for various differential equations. Equations within the realm of this package
include:

- Discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov)
  simulations)
- Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- Split and Partitioned ODEs (Symplectic integrators, IMEX Methods)
- Stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs)
- Random differential equations (RODEs or RDEs)
- Differential algebraic equations (DAEs)
- Delay differential equations (DDEs)
- Mixed discrete and continuous equations (Hybrid Equations, Jump Diffusions)
- (Stochastic) partial differential equations ((S)PDEs) (with both finite
  difference and finite element methods)

The well-optimized DifferentialEquations solvers benchmark as the some of the fastest
implementations, using classic algorithms and ones from recent research which
routinely outperform the "standard" C/Fortran methods, and include algorithms
optimized for high-precision and HPC applications. At the same time, it wraps
the classic C/Fortran methods, making it easy to switch over to them whenever
necessary. Solving differential equations with different methods from
different languages and packages can be done by changing one line of code,
allowing for easy benchmarking to ensure you are using the fastest method possible.

DifferentialEquations.jl integrates with the Julia package sphere with:

- GPU accleration through CUDAnative.jl and CuArrays.jl
- Automated sparsity detection with [SparsityDetection.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/SparsityDetection.jl)
- Automatic Jacobian coloring with [SparseDiffTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/SparseDiffTools.jl), allowing for fast solutions
  to problems with sparse or structured (Tridiagonal, Banded, BlockBanded, etc.) Jacobians
- Allowing the specification of linear solvers for maximal efficiency
- Progress meter integration with the Juno IDE for estimated time to solution
- Automatic plotting of time series and phase plots
- Built-in interpolations
- Wraps for common C/Fortran methods like Sundials and Hairer's radau
- Arbitrary precision with BigFloats and Arbfloats
- Arbitrary array types, allowing the definition of differential equations on
  matrices and distributed arrays
- Unit checked arithmetic with Unitful

Additionally, DifferentialEquations.jl comes with built-in analysis features, including:

- [Forward and Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis (Automatic Differentiation)](@ref sensitivity) for fast gradient computations
- [Parameter Estimation and Bayesian Analysis](@ref parameter_estimation)
- Neural differential equations with [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqFlux.jl)
  for efficient scientific machine learning (scientific ML) and scientific AI.
- Automatic distributed, multithreaded, and GPU [Parallel Ensemble Simulations](@ref ensemble)
- [Global Sensitivity Analysis](@ref gsa)
- [Uncertainty Quantification](@ref uncertainty_quantification)

## Getting Started: Installation And First Steps

### Installing from Julia

To install the package, use the following command inside the Julia REPL:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("DifferentialEquations")
```

To load the package, use the command:

```julia
using DifferentialEquations
```

This will add solvers and dependencies
for all kinds of Differential Equations (e.g. ODEs or SDEs etc., see the Supported
Equations section below). If you are interested in only one type of equation
solvers of `DifferentialEquations.jl` or simply want a more lightweight
version, see the
[Low Dependency Usage](@ref)
page.

To understand the package in more detail, check out the following tutorials in
this manual. **It is highly recommended that new users start with the
[ODE tutorial](@ref ode_example)**. Example IJulia notebooks
[can also be found in DiffEqTutorials.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqTutorials.jl).
If you find any example where there seems to be an error, please open an issue.

For the most up to date information on using the package, please join [the Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/JuliaDiffEq/Lobby).

Using the bleeding edge for the latest features and development is only recommended
for power users. Information on how to get to the bleeding edge is found in the
[developer documentation](https://juliadiffeq.github.io/DiffEqDevDocs.jl/dev/index.html#Bleeding-Edge-1).

### Installing from Python

Use of DifferentialEquations.jl from the Python programming language is available through the
[diffeqpy](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/diffeqpy) module. To install diffeqpy, use pip:

```
pip install diffeqpy
```

Using diffeqpy requires that Julia is installed and in the path, along
with DifferentialEquations.jl and PyCall.jl. To install Julia,
download a generic binary from
[the JuliaLang site](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and add it to your path.
To install Julia packages required for diffeqpy, open up Python
interpreter then run:

```pycon
>>> import diffeqpy
>>> diffeqpy.install()
```

and you're good! In addition, to improve the performance of your code it is
recommended that you use Numba to JIT compile your derivative functions. To
install Numba, use:

```
pip install numba
```

diffeqpy supports the majority of DifferentialEquations.jl with very similar
syntax, see [the diffeqpy README for more details](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/diffeqpy).
One important point to note is that Numba is generally an order of magnitude slower
than Julia in terms of  the generated differential equation solver code, and thus it is
recommended to use `julia.Main.eval` for Julia-side derivative function implementations
for maximal efficiency. See [this blog post](http://juliadiffeq.org/2018/04/30/Jupyter.html)
for more information.

### Installing from R

Use of DifferentialEquations.jl from the R programming language is available through the
[diffeqr](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/diffeqr) module.
[diffeqr is registered into CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diffeqr).
Thus to add the package, use:

```R
install.packages("diffeqr")
```

To install the master branch of the package (for developers), use:

```R
devtools::install_github('JuliaDiffEq/diffeqr', build_vignettes=T)
```

You will need a working installation of Julia in your path. To install Julia, download a generic binary
from [the JuliaLang site](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and add it to your path. The download and
installation of DifferentialEquations.jl will happen on the first invocation of `diffeqr::diffeq_setup()`.

Currently, use from R supported a subset of DifferentialEquations.jl which is documented
[through CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diffeqr/index.html).

### IJulia Notebook Tutorials

You can access extra tutorials supplied in the
[DiffEqTutorials.jl repository](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqTutorials.jl)
via the commands:

```julia

pkg"add https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqTutorials.jl"
using DiffEqTutorials
DiffEqTutorials.open_notebooks()
```

Or you can view the webpages for the rendered tutorials at the links found in the repository.

### Modeling Tools

While DifferentialEquations.jl can be used to directly build any differential
or difference equation (/ discrete stochastic) model, in many cases it can be
helpful to have a tailored-built API for making certain types of common models
easier. This is provided by the modeling functionality.

Pages = [
    "models/multiscale.md",
    "models/physical.md",
    "models/financial.md",
