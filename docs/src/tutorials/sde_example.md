# Stochastic Differential Equations

This tutorial will introduce you to the functionality for solving SDEs. Other
introductions can be found by [checking out DiffEqTutorials.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqTutorials.jl).

!!! note

    This tutorial assumes you have read the [Ordinary Differential Equations tutorial](@ref ode_example).

## Example 1: Scalar SDEs

In this example we will solve the equation

```math
du = f(u,p,t)dt + g(u,p,t)dW
```

where ``f(u,p,t)=αu`` and ``g(u,p,t)=βu``. We know via Stochastic Calculus that the
solution to this equation is

```math
u(t,Wₜ)=u₀\exp((α-\frac{β^2}{2})t+βWₜ)
```

To solve this numerically, we define a problem type by giving it the equation
and the initial condition:

```julia
using DifferentialEquations
α=1
β=1
u₀=1/2
f(u,p,t) = α*u
g(u,p,t) = β*u
dt = 1//2^(4)
tspan = (0.0,1.0)
prob = SDEProblem(f,g,u₀,(0.0,1.0))
```

The `solve` interface is then the same as with ODEs. Here we will use the classic
Euler-Maruyama algorithm `EM` and plot the solution:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,EM(),dt=dt)
using Plots; plotly() # Using the Plotly backend
plot(sol)
```

### Using Higher Order Methods

One unique feature of DifferentialEquations.jl is that higher-order methods for
stochastic differential equations are included. For reference, let's also give
the `SDEProblem` the analytical solution. We can do this by making a test problem.
This can be a good way to judge how accurate the algorithms are, or is used to
test convergence of the algorithms for methods developers. Thus we define the problem
object with:

```julia
f_analytic(u₀,p,t,W) = u₀*exp((α-(β^2)/2)*t+β*W)
ff = SDEFunction(f,g,analytic=f_analytic)
prob = SDEProblem(ff,g,u₀,(0.0,1.0))
```

and then we pass this information to the solver and plot:

```julia
#We can plot using the classic Euler-Maruyama algorithm as follows:
sol = solve(prob,EM(),dt=dt)
plot(sol,plot_analytic=true)
```

![SDE Solution](../assets/introSDEplot.png)

We can choose a higher-order solver for a more accurate result:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,SRIW1(),dt=dt,adaptive=false)
plot(sol,plot_analytic=true)
```

![Better SDE Solution](../assets/introSDEplotSRI.png)

By default, the higher order methods have adaptivity. Thus one can use

```julia
sol = solve(prob,SRIW1())
plot(sol,plot_analytic=true)
```

![Better Automatic Solution](../assets/sde_auto_time.png)

Here we allowed the solver to automatically determine a starting `dt`. This estimate
at the beginning is conservative (small) to ensure accuracy. We can instead start
the method with a larger `dt` by passing in a value for the starting `dt`:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,SRIW1(),dt=dt)
plot(sol,plot_analytic=true)
```

![Better Automatic Solution](../assets/sde_start_time.png)

### Ensemble Simulations

Instead of solving single trajectories, we can turn our problem into a `EnsembleProblem`
to solve many trajectories all at once. This is done by the `EnsembleProblem`
constructor:

```julia
ensembleprob = EnsembleProblem(prob)
```

The solver commands are defined [at the Parallel Ensemble Simulations page](@ref ensemble).
For example we can choose to have 1000 trajectories via `trajectories=1000`. In addition,
this will automatically parallelize using Julia native parallelism if extra processes
are added via `addprocs()`, but we can change this to use multithreading via
`EnsembleThreads()`. Together, this looks like:

```julia
sol = solve(ensembleprob,EnsembleThreads(),trajectories=1000)
```

Many more controls are defined at the [Ensemble simulations page](@ref ensemble), 
including analysis tools.
A very simple analysis can be done with the `EnsembleSummary`, which builds
mean/var statistics and has an associated plot recipe. For example, we can get
the statistics at every `0.01` timesteps and plot the average + error using:

```julia
using DifferentialEquations.EnsembleAnalysis
summ = EnsembleSummary(sol,0:0.01:1)
plot(summ,labels="Middle 95%")
summ = EnsembleSummary(sol,0:0.01:1;quantiles=[0.25,0.75])
plot!(summ,labels="Middle 50%",legend=true)
```

![sde_tutorial_monte](../assets/sde_tutorial_monte.png)

Additionally we can easily calculate the correlation between the values at `t=0.2`
and `t=0.7` via

```julia
timepoint_meancor(sim,0.2,0.7) # Gives both means and then the correlation coefficient
```

## Example 2: Systems of SDEs with Diagonal Noise

More generally, an SDE

```math
du = f(u,p,t)dt + g(u,p,t)dW
```

generalizes to systems of equations is done in the same way as ODEs. Here, `g`
is now a matrix of values. One common case, and the default for DifferentialEquations.jl,
is diagonal noise where `g` is a diagonal matrix. This means that every function in
the system gets a different random number. Instead of handling matrices in this case,
we simply define both `f` and `g` as in-place functions. Thus `f(du,u,p,t)` gives a
vector of `du` which is the deterministic change, and `g(du2,u,p,t)` gives a vector
`du2` for which `du2.*W` is the stochastic portion of the equation.

For example, the Lorenz equation with additive noise has the same deterministic
portion as the Lorenz equations, but adds an additive noise, which is simply
`3*N(0,dt)` where `N` is the normal distribution `dt` is the time step, to each
step of the equation. This is done via:

```julia
function lorenz(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = 10.0(u[2]-u[1])
  du[2] = u[1]*(28.0-u[3]) - u[2]
  du[3] = u[1]*u[2] - (8/3)*u[3]
end

function σ_lorenz(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = 3.0
  du[2] = 3.0
  du[3] = 3.0
end

prob_sde_lorenz = SDEProblem(lorenz,σ_lorenz,[1.0,0.0,0.0],(0.0,10.0))
sol = solve(prob_sde_lorenz)
plot(sol,vars=(1,2,3))
```

![stochastic_3d_lorenz](../assets/stochastic_3d_lorenz.png)

Note that it's okay for the noise function to mix terms. For example

```julia
function σ_lorenz(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = sin(u[3])*3.0
  du[2] = u[2]*u[1]*3.0
  du[3] = 3.0
end
```

is a valid noise function, which will once again give diagonal noise by `du2.*W`.

## Example 3: Systems of SDEs with Scalar Noise

In this example we'll solve a system of SDEs with scalar noise. This means that
the same noise process is applied to all SDEs. First we need to define a
scalar noise process
[using the Noise Process interface](@ref noise_process).
Since we want a `WienerProcess` that starts at `0.0` at time `0.0`, we use the
command `W = WienerProcess(0.0,0.0,0.0)` to define the Brownian motion we want,
and then give this to the `noise` option in the `SDEProblem`. For a full example,
let's solve a linear SDE with scalar noise using a high order algorithm:

```julia
f(du,u,p,t) = (du .= u)
g(du,u,p,t) = (du .= u)
u0 = rand(4,2)

W = WienerProcess(0.0,0.0,0.0)
prob = SDEProblem(f,g,u0,(0.0,1.0),noise=W)
sol = solve(prob,SRIW1())
```

![Scalar Noise](../assets/matrix_sde_scalar_noise.png)

## Example 4: Systems of SDEs with Non-Diagonal Noise

In the previous examples we had diagonal noise, that is a vector of random numbers
`dW` whose size matches the output of `g` where the noise is applied element-wise,
and scalar noise where a single random variable is applied to all dependent variables.
However, a more general type of noise allows for the terms to linearly mixed via `g`
being a matrix.

(Note that nonlinear mixings are not SDEs but fall under the more general class of
random ordinary differential equations (RODEs) which have a
[separate set of solvers](@ref rode_example).

Let's define a problem with four Wiener processes and two dependent random variables.
In this case, we will want the output of `g` to be a 2x4 matrix, such that the solution
is `g(u,p,t)*dW`, the matrix multiplication. For example, we can do the following:

```julia
f(du,u,p,t) = du .= 1.01u
function g(du,u,p,t)
  du[1,1] = 0.3u[1]
  du[1,2] = 0.6u[1]
  du[1,3] = 0.9u[1]
  du[1,4] = 0.12u[2]
  du[2,1] = 1.2u[1]
  du[2,2] = 0.2u[2]
  du[2,3] = 0.3u[2]
  du[2,4] = 1.8u[2]
end
prob = SDEProblem(f,g,ones(2),(0.0,1.0),noise_rate_prototype=zeros(2,4))
```
In our `g` we define the functions for computing the values of the matrix.
We can now think of the SDE that this solves as the system of equations

```math
du_1 = f_1(u,p,t)dt + g_{11}(u,p,t)dW_1 + g_{12}(u,p,t)dW_2 + g_{13}(u,p,t)dW_3 + g_{14}(u,p,t)dW_4 \\
du_2 = f_2(u,p,t)dt + g_{21}(u,p,t)dW_1 + g_{22}(u,p,t)dW_2 + g_{23}(u,p,t)dW_3 + g_{24}(u,p,t)dW_4
```

meaning that for example `du[1,1]` and `du[2,1]` correspond to stochastic changes with
the same random number in the first and second SDEs.


!!! note
    This problem can only be solved my SDE methods which are compatible with non-diagonal
    noise. This is discussed [in the SDE solvers page](@ref sde_solve).

The matrix itself is determined by the keyword argument `noise_rate_prototype` in the `SDEProblem`
constructor. This is a prototype for the type that `du` will be in `g`. This can
be any `AbstractMatrix` type. Thus for example, we can define the problem as

```julia

# Define a sparse matrix by making a dense matrix and setting some values as not zero
A = zeros(2,4)
A[1,1] = 1
A[1,4] = 1
A[2,4] = 1
A=sparse(A)

# Make `g` write the sparse matrix values
function g(du,u,p,t)
  du[1,1] = 0.3u[1]
  du[1,4] = 0.12u[2]
  du[2,4] = 1.8u[2]
end

# Make `g` use the sparse matrix
prob = SDEProblem(f,g,ones(2),(0.0,1.0),noise_rate_prototype=A)
```

and now `g(u,p,t)` writes into a sparse matrix, and `g(u,p,t)*dW` is sparse matrix
multiplication.

## Example 4: Colored Noise

Colored noise can be defined [using the Noise Process interface](@ref noise_process).
In that portion of the docs, it is shown how to define your own noise process
`my_noise`, which can be passed to the SDEProblem

```julia
SDEProblem(f,g,u0,tspan,noise=my_noise)
```

Note that general colored noise problems are only compatible with the `EM` and `EulerHeun` methods.
This is discussed [in the SDE solvers page](@ref sde_solve).

### Example: Spatially-Colored Noise in the Heston Model

Let's define the Heston equation from financial mathematics:

```math
dS = μSdt + \sqrt{v}SdW_1 \\
dv = κ(Θ-v)dt + σ\sqrt{v}dW_2 \\
dW_1 dW_2 = ρ dt
```

In this problem, we have a diagonal noise problem given by:

```julia
function f(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = μ*u[1]
  du[2] = κ*(Θ-u[2])
end
function g(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = √u[2]*u[1]
  du[2] = Θ*√u[2]
end
```

However, our noise has a correlation matrix for some constant `ρ`. Choosing `ρ=0.2`:

```julia
Γ = [1 ρ;ρ 1]
```

To solve this, we can define a `CorrelatedWienerProcess` which starts at zero (`W(0)=0`)
via:

```julia
heston_noise = CorrelatedWienerProcess!(Γ,tspan[1],zeros(2),zeros(2))
```

This is then used to build the SDE:

```julia
SDEProblem(f,g,u0,tspan,noise=heston_noise)
```

Of course, to fully define this problem we need to define our constants. Constructors
for making common models like this easier to define can be found in the modeling
toolkits. For example, the `HestonProblem` is pre-defined as part of the
[financial modeling tools](@ref financial_models).
