# [Noise Processes](@id noise_process)

Noise processes are essential in continuous stochastic modeling. The `NoiseProcess`
types are distributionally-exact, meaning they are not solutions of
stochastic differential equations and instead are directly generated according
to their analytical distributions. These processes are used as the noise term
in the SDE and RODE solvers. Additionally, the noise processes themselves can
be simulated and solved using the DiffEq common interface (including the Monte
Carlo interface).

This page first describes how to use noise processes in SDEs, and analyze/simulate
them directly noise processes. Then it describes the standard noise processes
which are available. Processes like `WienerProcess`, `CorrelatedWienerProcess`,
`GeometricBrownianMotionProcess`, `BrownianBridgeProcess` and
`OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess` are pre-defined. Then it is shown how one can define
the distributions for a new `NoiseProcess`.

In addition to the `NoiseProcess` type, more general `AbstractNoiseProcess`es
are defined. The `NoiseGrid` allows you to define a noise process from a set
of pre-calculated points (the "normal" way). The `NoiseApproximation` allows
you to define a new noise process as the solution to some stochastic differential
equation. While these methods are only approximate, they are more general and
allow the user to easily define their own colored noise to use in simulations.

The `NoiseWrapper` allows one to wrap a `NoiseProcess` from a previous simulation
to re-use it in a new simulation in a way that follows the same stochastic
trajectory (even if different points are hit, for example solving with a
smaller `dt`) in a distributionally-exact manner. It is demonstrated how the
`NoiseWrapper` can be used to wrap the `NoiseProcess` of one SDE/RODE solution
in order to re-use the same noise process in another simulation.

Lastly, the `NoiseFunction` allows you to use any function of time as the
noise process. Together, this functionality allows you to define any colored
noise process and use this efficiently and accurately in your simulations.

## Using Noise Processes

### Passing a Noise Process to a Problem Type

`AbstractNoiseProcess`es can be passed directly to the problem types to replace
the standard Wiener process (Brownian motion) with your choice of noise. To do
this, simply construct the noise and pass it to the `noise` keyword argument:

```julia
μ = 1.0
σ = 2.0
W = GeometricBrownianMotionProcess(μ,σ,0.0,1.0,1.0)
# ...
# Define f,g,u0,tspan for a SDEProblem
# ...
prob = SDEProblem(f,g,u0,tspan,noise=W)
```

### Basic Interface

The `NoiseProcess` acts like a DiffEq solution. For some noise process `W`, you
can get its `i`th timepoint like `W[i]` and the associated time `W.t[i]`. If the
`NoiseProcess` has a bridging distribution defined, it can be interpolated to
arbitrary time points using `W(t)`. Note that every interpolated value is saved
to the `NoiseProcess` so that way it can stay distributionally correct. A plot
recipe is provided which plots the timeseries.

### Direct Simulation of the Noise Process

Since the `NoiseProcess` types are distribution-exact and do not require the
stochastic differential equation solvers, many times one would like to directly
simulate trajectories from these proecesses. The `NoiseProcess` has a
`NoiseProcessProblem` type:

```julia
NoiseProblem(noise,tspan)
```

for which `solve` works. For example, we can simulate a distributionally-exact
Geometric Brownian Motion solution by:

```julia
μ = 1.0
σ = 2.0
W = GeometricBrownianMotionProcess(μ,σ,0.0,1.0,1.0)
prob = NoiseProblem(W,(0.0,1.0))
sol = solve(prob;dt=0.1)
```

`solve` requires the `dt` is given, the solution it returns is a `NoiseProcess`
which has stepped through the timespan. Because this follows the common interface,
all of the normal functionality works. For example, we can use the Monte Carlo
functionality as follows:

```julia
monte_prob = MonteCarloProblem(prob)
sol = solve(monte_prob;dt=0.1,num_monte=100)
```

simulates 100 Geometric Brownian Motions.

### Direct Interface

Most of the time, a `NoiseProcess` is received from the solution of a stochastic
or random differential equation, in which case `sol.W` gives the `NoiseProcess`
and it is already defined along some timeseries. In other cases, `NoiseProcess`
types are directly simulated (see below). However, `NoiseProcess` types can also
be directly acted on. The basic functionality is given by `calculate_step!`
to calculate a future time point, and `accept_step!` to accept the step. If steps
are rejected, the Rejection Sampling with Memory algorithm is applied to keep
the solution distributionally exact. This kind of stepping is done via:

```julia
W = WienerProcess(0.0,1.0,1.0)
dt = 0.1
W.dt = dt
setup_next_step!(W)
for i in 1:10
  accept_step!(W,dt)
end
```

## Noise Process Types

This section describes the available `NoiseProcess` types. Note that all
keyword arguments are splatted into the `NoiseProcess` constructor, and thus
options like `reset` are available on the pre-built processes.

### Wiener Process

The `WienerProcess`, also known as Brownian motion, or
the noise in the Langevin equation, is the stationary process with 
white noise increments and a distribution `N(0,t)`. The constructor is:

```julia
WienerProcess(t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
WienerProcess!(t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
```

### Real Wiener Process

The `RealWienerProcess` is a Brownian motion that is forced to be
real-valued. While the normal `WienerProcess` becomes complex valued
if `W0` is complex, this verion is real valued for when you want to,
for example, solve an SDE defined by complex numbers where the noise
is in the reals.

```julia
RealWienerProcess(t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
RealWienerProcess!(t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
```

### Correlated Noise

One can define a `CorrelatedWienerProcess` which is a Wiener process with
correlations between the Wiener processes. The constructor is:

```julia
CorrelatedWienerProcess(Γ,t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
CorrelatedWienerProcess!(Γ,t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
```

where `Γ` is the constant covariance matrix.

### Geometric Brownian Motion

A `GeometricBrownianMotion` process is a Wiener process with
constant drift `μ` and constant diffusion `σ`. I.e. this is the solution of the
stochastic differential equation

```math
dX_t = \mu X_t dt + \sigma X_t dW_t
```

The `GeometricBrownianMotionProcess` is distribution exact (meaning, not a numerical
solution of the stochastic differential equation, and instead follows the exact
distribution properties). It can be back interpolated exactly as well. The constructor is:

```julia
GeometricBrownianMotionProcess(μ,σ,t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
GeometricBrownianMotionProcess!(μ,σ,t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
```

### Brownian Bridge

A `BrownianBridge` process is a Wiener process with a pre-defined start and end
value. This process is distribution exact and back be back interpolated exactly
as well. The constructor is:

```julia
BrownianBridge(t0,tend,W0,Wend,Z0=nothing,Zend=nothing;kwargs...)
BrownianBridge!(t0,tend,W0,Wend,Z0=nothing,Zend=nothing;kwargs...)
```

where `W(t0)=W₀`, `W(tend)=Wend`, and likewise for the `Z` process if defined.

### Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

One can define a `Ornstein-Uhlenbeck` process which is a Wiener process defined
by the stochastic differential equation

```math
dX_t = \theta (\mu - X_t) dt + \sigma dW_t
```

The `OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess` is distribution exact (meaning, not a numerical
solution of the stochastic differential equation, and instead follows the exact
distribution properties). The constructor is:

```julia
OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess(Θ,μ,σ,t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess!(Θ,μ,σ,t0,W0,Z0=nothing;kwargs...)
```

### Direct Construction of a NoiseProcess

A `NoiseProcess` is a type defined as

```julia
NoiseProcess(t0,W0,Z0,dist,bridge;
             iip=DiffEqBase.isinplace(dist,3),
             rswm = RSWM(),save_everystep=true,
             rng = Xorshifts.Xoroshiro128Plus(rand(UInt64)),
             reset = true, reseed = true)
```

- `t0` is the first timepoint
- `W0` is the first value of the process.
- `Z0` is the first value of the psudo-process. This is necessary for higher
  order algorithms. If it's not needed, set to `nothing`.
- `dist` the distribution for the steps over time.
- `bridge` the bridging distribution. Optional, but required for adaptivity and interpolating
  at new values.
- `save_everystep` whether to save every step of the Brownian timeseries.
- `rng` the local RNG used for generating the random numbers.
- `reset` whether to reset the process with each solve.
- `reseed` whether to reseed the process with each solve.

The signature for the `dist` is

```julia
dist!(rand_vec,W,dt,rng)
```

for inplace functions, and

```julia
rand_vec = dist(W,dt,rng)
```

otherwise. The signature for `bridge` is

```julia
bridge!(rand_vec,W,W0,Wh,q,h,rng)
```

and the out of place syntax is

```julia
rand_vec = bridge!(W,W0,Wh,q,h,rng)
```

Here, `W` is the noise process, `W0` is the left side of the current interval,
`Wh` is the right side of the current interval, `h` is the interval length,
and `q` is the proportion from the left where the interpolation is occuring.

### Direct Construction Example

The easiest way to show how to directly construct a `NoiseProcess` is by example.
Here we will show how to directly construct a `NoiseProcess` which generates
Gaussian white noise.

This is the noise process which uses `randn!`. A special dispatch is added for
complex numbers for `(randn()+im*randn())/sqrt(2)`. This function is
`DiffEqBase.wiener_randn` (or with `!` respectively).

The first function that must be defined is the noise distribution. This is how
to generate ``W(t+dt)`` given that we know ``W(x)`` for ``x∈[t₀,t]``. For Gaussian
white noise, we know that

```math
W(dt) ∼ N(0,dt)
```

for ``W(0)=0`` which defines the stepping distribution. Thus its noise distribution
function is:

```julia
@inline function WHITE_NOISE_DIST(W,dt,rng)
  if typeof(W.dW) <: AbstractArray && !(typeof(W.dW) <: SArray)
    return @fastmath sqrt(abs(dt))*wiener_randn(rng,W.dW)
  else
    return @fastmath sqrt(abs(dt))*wiener_randn(rng,typeof(W.dW))
  end
end
```

for the out of place versions, and for the inplace versions

```julia
function INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_DIST(rand_vec,W,dt,rng)
  wiener_randn!(rng,rand_vec)
  sqrtabsdt = @fastmath sqrt(abs(dt))
  @. rand_vec *= sqrtabsdt
end
```

Optionally, we can provide a bridging distribution. This is the distribution of
``W(qh)`` for ``q∈[0,1]`` given that we know ``W(0)=0`` and ``W(h)=Wₕ``. For
Brownian motion, this is known as the Brownian Bridge, and is well known to have
the distribution:

```math
W(qh) ∼ N(qWₕ,(1-q)qh)
```

Thus we have the out-of-place and in-place versions as:

```julia
function WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE(W,W0,Wh,q,h,rng)
  if typeof(W.dW) <: AbstractArray
    return @fastmath sqrt((1-q)*q*abs(h))*wiener_randn(rng,W.dW)+q*Wh
  else
    return @fastmath sqrt((1-q)*q*abs(h))*wiener_randn(rng,typeof(W.dW))+q*Wh
  end
end
function INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE(rand_vec,W,W0,Wh,q,h,rng)
  wiener_randn!(rng,rand_vec)
  #rand_vec .= sqrt((1.-q).*q.*abs(h)).*rand_vec.+q.*Wh
  sqrtcoeff = @fastmath sqrt((1-q)*q*abs(h))
  @. rand_vec = sqrtcoeff*rand_vec+q*Wh
end
```

These functions are then placed in a noise process:

```julia
NoiseProcess(t0,W0,Z0,WHITE_NOISE_DIST,WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE;kwargs)
NoiseProcess(t0,W0,Z0,INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_DIST,INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE;kwargs)
```

Notice that we can optionally provide an alternative adaptive algorithm for the
timestepping rejections. `RSWM()` defaults to the Rejection Sampling with Memory
3 algorithm (RSwM3).

Note that the standard constructors are simply:

```julia
WienerProcess(t0,W0,Z0=nothing) = NoiseProcess(t0,W0,Z0,WHITE_NOISE_DIST,WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE;kwargs)
WienerProcess!(t0,W0,Z0=nothing) = NoiseProcess(t0,W0,Z0,INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_DIST,INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE;kwargs)
```

These will generate a Wiener process, which can be stepped with `step!(W,dt)`, and interpolated as `W(t)`.

## Non-Standard Noise Processes

In addition to the mathematically-defined noise processes above, there exists
more generic functionality for building noise processes from other noise processes,
from arbitrary functions, from arrays, and from approximations of stochastic
differential equations.

### NoiseWrapper

This produces a new noise process from an old one, which will use its interpolation
to generate the noise. This allows you to re-use a previous noise process not just
with the same timesteps, but also with new (adaptive) timesteps as well. Thus
this is very good for doing Multi-level Monte Carlo schemes and strong
convergence testing.

To wrap a noise process, simply use:

```julia
NoiseWrapper(W::NoiseProcess;reset=true)
```

### NoiseFunction

This allows you to use any arbitrary function `W(t)` as a `NoiseProcess`. This
will use the function lazily, only caching values required to minimize function
calls, but not store the entire noise array. This requires an initial time point
`t0` in the domain of `W`. A second function is needed if the desired SDE algorithm
requires multiple processes.

```julia
NoiseFunction(t0,W,Z=nothing;noise_prototype=W(t0),reset=true)
```

Additionally, one can use an in-place function `W(out1,out2,t)` for more efficient
generation of the arrays for multi-dimensional processes. When the in-place version
is used without a dispatch for the out-of-place version, the `noise_prototype`
needs to be set.

### NoiseGrid

A noise grid builds a noise process from arrays of points. For example, you
can generate your desired noise process as an array `W` with timepoints `t`,
and use the constructor:

```julia
NoiseGrid(t,W,Z=nothing;reset=true)
```

to build the associated noise process. This process comes with a linear
interpolation of the given points, and thus the grid does not have to match
the grid of integration. Thus this can be used for adaptive solutions as
well. However, one must make note that the fidelity of the noise process
is linked to how fine the noise grid is determined: if the noise grid is
sparse on points compared to the integration, then its distributional
properties may be slightly perturbed by the linear interpolation. Thus its
suggested that the grid size at least approximately match the number of
time steps in the integration to ensure accuracy.

For a one-dimensional process, `W` should be an `AbstractVector` of `Number`s.
For multi-dimensional processes, `W` should be an `AbstractVector` of the
`noise_prototype`.

### NoiseApproximation

In many cases, one would like to define a noise process directly by a stochastic
differential equation which does not have an analytical solution. Of course,
this will not be distributionally-exact and how well the properties match
depends on how well the differential equation is integrated, but in many
cases this can be used as a good approximation when other methods are much
more difficult.

A `NoiseApproximation` is defined by a `DEIntegrator`. The constructor for a
`NoiseApproximation` is:

```julia
NoiseApproximation(source1::DEIntegrator,source2::Union{DEIntegrator,Nothing}=nothing;reset=true)
```

The `DEIntegrator` should have a final time point of integration far enough such
that it will not halt during the integration. For ease of use, you can use a
final time point as `Inf`. Note that the time points do not have to match the
time points of the future integration since the interpolant of the SDE solution
will be used. Thus the limiting factor is error tolerance and not hitting specific
points.

## Examples Using Non-Standard Noise Processes

### NoiseGrid

In this example, we will show you how to define your own version of Brownian
motion using an array of pre-calculated points. In normal usage you should use
`WienerProcess` instead since this will have distributionally-exact interpolations
while the noise grid uses linear interpolations, but this is a nice example
of the workflow.

To define a `NoiseGrid` you need to have a set of time points and a set of
values for the process. Let's define a Brownian motion on `(0.0,1.0)` with
a `dt=0.001`. To do this,

```julia
dt = 0.001
t = 0:dt:1
brownian_values = cumsum([0;[sqrt(dt)*randn() for i in 1:length(t)-1]])
```

Now we build the `NoiseGrid` using these values:

```julia
W = NoiseGrid(t,brownian_values)
```

We can then pass `W` as the `noise` argument of an `SDEProblem` to use it in
an SDE.

### NoiseWrapper Example

In this example, we will solve an SDE three times:

- First to generate a noise process
- Second with the same timesteps to show the values are the same
- Third with half-sized timsteps

First we will generate a noise process by solving an SDE:

```julia
using StochasticDiffEq,  DiffEqBase, DiffEqNoiseProcess
f1(u, p, t) = 1.01u
g1(u, p, t) = 1.01u
dt = 1//2^(4)
prob1 = SDEProblem(f1,g1,1.0,(0.0,1.0))
sol1 = solve(prob1,EM(),dt=dt,save_noise = true)
```

Now we wrap the noise into a NoiseWrapper and solve the same problem:

```julia
W2 = NoiseWrapper(sol1.W)
prob1 = SDEProblem(f1,g1,1.0,(0.0,1.0),noise=W2)
sol2 = solve(prob1,EM(),dt=dt)
```

We can test

```julia
@test sol1.u ≈ sol2.u
```

to see that the values are essentially equal. Now we can use the same process
to solve the same trajectory with a smaller `dt`:

```julia
W3 = NoiseWrapper(sol1.W)
prob2 = SDEProblem(f1,g1,1.0,(0.0,1.0),noise=W3)

dt = 1//2^(5)
sol3 = solve(prob2,EM(),dt=dt)
```

We can plot the results to see what this looks like:

```julia
using Plots
plot(sol1)
plot!(sol2)
plot!(sol3)
```

![noise_process](../assets/noise_process.png)

In this plot, `sol2` covers up `sol1` because they hit essentially the same
values. You can see that `sol3` its similar to the others, because it's
using the same underlying noise process just sampled much finer.

To double check, we see that:

```julia
plot(sol1.W)
plot!(sol2.W)
plot!(sol3.W)
```

![coupled_wiener](../assets/coupled_wiener.png)

the coupled Wiener processes coincide at every other time point, and the intermediate
timepoints were calculated according to a Brownian bridge.


### Adaptive NoiseWrapper Example

Here we will show that the same noise can be used with the adaptive methods
using the `NoiseWrapper`. `SRI` and `SRIW1` use slightly different error
estimators, and thus give slightly different stepping behavior. We can
see how they solve the same 2D SDE differently by using the noise
wrapper:

```julia
prob = SDEProblem(f1,g1,ones(2),(0.0,1.0))
sol4 = solve(prob,SRI(),abstol=1e-8, save_noise = true)

W2 = NoiseWrapper(sol4.W)
prob2 = SDEProblem(f1,g1,ones(2),(0.0,1.0),noise=W2)
sol5 = solve(prob2,SRIW1(),abstol=1e-8)

using Plots
plot(sol4)
plot!(sol5)
```

![SRI_SRIW1_diff](../assets/SRI_SRIW1_diff.png)

### NoiseApproximation Example

In this example we will show how to use the `NoiseApproximation` in order to
build our own Geometric Brownian Motion from its stochastic differential
equation definition. In normal usage, you should use the `GeometricBrownianMotionProcess`
instead since that is more efficient and distributionally-exact.

First, let's define the `SDEProblem`. Here will use a timespan `(0.0,Inf)` so
that way the noise can be used over an indefinite integral.

```julia
const μ = 1.5
const σ = 1.2
f(u, p, t) = μ*u
g(u, p, t) = σ*u
prob = SDEProblem(f,g,1.0,(0.0,Inf))
```

Now we build the noise process by building the integrator and sending that
integrator to the `NoiseApproximation` constructor:

```julia
integrator = init(prob,SRIW1())
W = NoiseApproximation(integrator)
```

We can use this noise process like any other noise process. For example, we
can now build a geometric Brownian motion whose noise process is colored noise
that itself is a geometric Brownian motion:

```julia
prob = SDEProblem(f,g,1.0,(0.0,Inf),noise=W)
```

The possibilities are endless.

### NoiseFunction Example

The `NoiseFunction` is pretty simple: pass a function. As a silly example, we
can use `exp` as a noise process by doing:

```julia
f(t) = exp(t)
W = NoiseFunction(0.0,f)
```

If it's multi-dimensional and an in-place function is used, the `noise_prototype`
must be given. For example:

```julia
f(out,t) = (out.=exp(t))
W = NoiseFunction(0.0,f,noise_prototype=rand(4))
```

This allows you to put arbitrarily weird noise into SDEs and RODEs. Have fun.
