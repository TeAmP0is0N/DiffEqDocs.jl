# DAE Solvers

## Recommended Methods

For medium to low accuracy small numbers of DAEs in constant mass matrices form,
the  `Rosenbrock23` and `Rodas5` methods are good choices which will get good
efficiency if the mass matrix is constant. `Rosenbrock23` is better for low
accuracy (error tolerance `<1e-4`) and `Rodas5` is better for high accuracy.
Another choice at high accuracy is `RadauIIA5`.

Non-constant mass matrices are not directly supported: users are advised to
transform their problem through substitution to a DAE with constant mass
matrices.

If the problem cannot be defined in mass matrix form, the recommended method for
performance is `IDA` from the Sundials.jl package if you are solving problems with
`Float64`. If Julia types are required, currently `DABDF2` is the best method.

## [Full List of Methods](@id dae_solve_full)

#### Initialization Schemes

For all OrdinaryDiffEq.jl methods, an initialization scheme can be set with a
common keyword argument `initializealg`. The choices are:

- `BrownFullBasicInit`: For Index-1 DAEs implicit DAEs and and semi-explicit
  DAEs in mass matrix form. Keeps the differential variables constant. Requires
  `du0` when used on a `DAEProblem`.
- `ShampineCollocationInit`: For Index-1 DAEs implicit DAEs and and semi-explicit
  DAEs in mass matrix form. Changes both the differential and algebraic variables.
- `NoInit`: Explicitly opts-out of DAE initialization.

### OrdinaryDiffEq.jl (Implicit ODE)

These methods from OrdinaryDiffEq are for `DAEProblem` specifications.

- `DImplicitEuler` - 1st order A-L and stiffly stable adaptive implicit Euler
- `DABDF2` - 2nd order A-L stable adaptive BDF method.

### OrdinaryDiffEq.jl (Mass Matrix)

These methods require the DAE to be an `ODEProblem` in mass matrix form. For
extra options for the solvers, see the ODE solver page.

#### Rosenbrock Methods

- `ROS3P` - 3rd order A-stable and stiffly stable Rosenbrock method. Keeps high
  accuracy on discretizations of nonlinear parabolic PDEs.
- `Rodas3` - 3rd order A-stable and stiffly stable Rosenbrock method.
- `RosShamp4`- An A-stable 4th order Rosenbrock method.
- `Veldd4` - A 4th order D-stable Rosenbrock method.
- `Velds4` - A 4th order A-stable Rosenbrock method.
- `GRK4T` - An efficient 4th order Rosenbrock method.
- `GRK4A` - An A-stable 4th order Rosenbrock method. Essentially "anti-L-stable"
  but efficient.

  stiff-aware 3rd order interpolant
- `Rodas4P` - A 4th order A-stable stiffly stable Rosenbrock method with a
  stiff-aware 3rd order interpolant. 4th order on linear parabolic problems
  and 3rd order accurate on nonlinear parabolic problems (as opposed to lower
  if not corrected).
- `Rodas5` - A 5th order A-stable stiffly stable Rosenbrock method. Currently has
  a Hermite interpolant because its stiff-aware 3rd order interpolant is not
  yet implemented.

#### Rosenbrock-W Methods

- `Rosenbrock23` - An Order 2/3 L-Stable Rosenbrock-W method which is good for very stiff equations with oscillations at low tolerances. 2nd order stiff-aware interpolation.
- `Rosenbrock32` - An Order 3/2 A-Stable Rosenbrock-W method which is good for mildy stiff equations without oscillations at low tolerances. Note that this method is prone to instability in the presence of oscillations, so use with caution. 2nd order stiff-aware interpolation.

#### FIRK Methods

- `RadauIIA5` - An A-B-L stable fully implicit Runge-Kutta method with internal
  tableau complex basis transform for efficiency.

#### SDIRK Methods

- `ImplicitEuler` - Stage order 1. A-B-L-stable. Adaptive
  timestepping through a divided differences estimate via memory. Strong-stability
  presurving (SSP).
- `ImplicitMidpoint` - Stage order 1. Symplectic. Good for when symplectic
  integration is required.
- `Trapezoid` - A second order A-stable symmetric ESDIRK method. "Almost
  symplectic" without numerical dampening. Also known as Crank-Nicolson when
  applied to PDEs. Adaptive timestepping via divided differences on the memory.
  Good for highly stiff equations which are non-oscillatory.

#### Multistep Methods

Quasi-constant stepping is the time stepping strategy which matches the classic
GEAR, LSODE,  and `ode15s` integrators. The variable-coefficient methods match
the ideas of the classic EPISODE integrator and early VODE designs. The Fixed
Leading Coefficient (FLC) methods match the behavior of the classic VODE and
Sundials CVODE integrator.

- `QNDF1` - An adaptive order 1 quasi-constant timestep L-stable numerical
  differentiation function (NDF) method. Optional parameter `kappa` defaults
  to Shampine's accuracy-optimal `-0.1850`.
- `QBDF1` - An adaptive order 1 L-stable BDF method. This is equivalent to
  implicit Euler but using the BDF error estimator.
- `ABDF2` - An adaptive order 2 L-stable fixed leading coefficient multistep
  BDF method.
- `QNDF2` - An adaptive order 2 quasi-constant timestep L-stable numerical
  differentiation function (NDF) method.
- `QBDF2` - An adaptive order 2 L-stable BDF method using quasi-constant timesteps.
- `QNDF` - An adaptive order quasi-constant timestep NDF method. Utilizes
  Shampine's accuracy-optimal `kappa` values as defaults (has a keyword argument
  for a tuple of `kappa` coefficients).
- `QBDF` - An adaptive order quasi-constant timestep BDF method.

### Sundials.jl

Note that this setup is not automatically included with DifferentialEquations.jl.
To use the following algorithms, you must install and use Sundials.jl:

```julia
]add Sundials
using Sundials
```

- `IDA` - This is the IDA method from the Sundials.jl package.

Note that the constructors for the Sundials algorithms take a main argument:

- `linearsolver` - This is the linear solver which is used in the Newton iterations.
  The choices are:

  - `:Dense` - A dense linear solver.
  - `:Band` - A solver specialized for banded Jacobians. If used, you must set the
    position of the upper and lower non-zero diagonals via `jac_upper` and
    `jac_lower`.
  - `:LapackDense` - A version of the dense linear solver that uses the Julia-provided
    OpenBLAS-linked LAPACK for multithreaded operations. This will be faster than
    `:Dense` on larger systems but has noticable overhead on smaller (<100 ODE) systems.
  - `:LapackBand` - A version of the banded linear solver that uses the Julia-provided
    OpenBLAS-linked LAPACK for multithreaded operations. This will be faster than
    `:Band` on larger systems but has noticable overhead on smaller (<100 ODE) systems.
  - `:GMRES` - A GMRES method. Recommended first choice Krylov method
  - `:BCG` - A Biconjugate gradient method.
  - `:PCG` - A preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Only for symmetric linear systems.
  - `:TFQMR` - A TFQMR method.
  - `:KLU` - A sparse factorization method. Requires that the user specifies a
    Jacobian. The Jacobian must be set as a sparse matrix in the `ODEProblem`
    type.

Example:

```julia
IDA() # Newton + Dense solver
IDA(linear_solver=:Band,jac_upper=3,jac_lower=3) # Banded solver with nonzero diagonals 3 up and 3 down
IDA(linear_solver=:BCG) # Biconjugate gradient method                                   
```

All of the additional options are available. The constructor is:

```julia
IDA(;linear_solver=:Dense,jac_upper=0,jac_lower=0,krylov_dim=0,
    max_order = 5,
    max_error_test_failures = 7,
    max_nonlinear_iters = 3,
    nonlinear_convergence_coefficient = 0.33,
    nonlinear_convergence_coefficient_ic = 0.0033,
    max_num_steps_ic = 5,
    max_num_jacs_ic = 4,
    max_num_iters_ic = 10,
    max_num_backs_ic = 100,
    use_linesearch_ic = true,
    max_convergence_failures = 10,
    init_all = false,
    prec = nothing, psetup = nothing, prec_side = 0)
```

See [the Sundials manual](https://computation.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/public/ida_guide.pdf)
for details on the additional options. The option `init_all` controls the initial condition
consistency routine. If the initial conditions are inconsistant (i.e. they do not satisfy the
implicit equation), `init_all=false` means that the algebraic variables and derivatives will
be modified in order to satisfy the DAE. If `init_all=true`, all initial conditions will be
modified to satify the DAE.

Note that here `prec` is a preconditioner function
`prec(z,r,p,t,y,fy,gamma,delta,lr)` where:

- `z`: the computed output vector
- `r`: the right-hand side vector of the linear system
- `p`: the parameters
- `t`: the current independent variable
- `du`: the current value of `f(u,p,t)`
- `gamma`: the `gamma` of `W = M - gamma*J`
- `delta`: the iterative method tolerance
- `lr`: a flag for whether `lr=1` (left) or `lr=2` (right)
  preconditioning

and `psetup` is the preconditioner setup function for pre-computing Jacobian
information. Where:

- `p`: the parameters
- `t`: the current independent variable
- `resid`: the current residual
- `u`: the current state
- `du`: the current derivative of the state
- `gamma`: the `gamma` of `W = M - gamma*J`

`psetup` is optional when `prec` is set.

### DASKR.jl

DASKR.jl is not automatically included by DifferentialEquations.jl. To use this
algorithm, you will need to install and use the package:

```julia
]add DASKR
using DASKR
```

- `daskr` - This is a wrapper for the well-known DASKR algorithm.

All additional options are available. The constructor is:

```julia
function daskr(;linear_solver=:Dense,
                  jac_upper=0,jac_lower=0,max_order = 5,
                  non_negativity_enforcement = 0,
                  non_negativity_enforcement_array = nothing,
                  max_krylov_iters = nothing,
                  num_krylov_vectors = nothing,
                  max_number_krylov_restarts = 5,
                  krylov_convergence_test_constant = 0.05,
                  exclude_algebraic_errors = false)
```

Choices for the linear solver are:

- `:Dense`
- `:Banded`
- `:SPIGMR`, a Krylov method

### DASSL.jl

- `dassl` - A native Julia implementation of the DASSL algorithm.

### ODEInterfaceDiffEq.jl

These methods require the DAE to be an `ODEProblem` in mass matrix form. For
extra options for the solvers, see the ODE solver page.
